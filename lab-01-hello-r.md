## Load packages and data

``` r
library(tidyverse) 
library(datasauRus)
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

datasaurus\_dozen %\>% count(dataset) %\>% print(13)

There are 1846 rows and 3 variables in the data frame. In the output
there are 13 rows and 2 columns and for each dataset there is an n of
142.

### Exercise 2

First let’s plot the data in the dino dataset:

``` r
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "dino")

ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](lab-01-hello-r_files/figure-gfm/plot-dino-1.png)<!-- -->

And next calculate the correlation between `x` and `y` in this dataset:

``` r
dino_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##         r
    ##     <dbl>
    ## 1 -0.0645

### Exercise 3

Add code and narrative as needed. Note that the R chunks are labelled
with `plot-star` and `cor-star` to provide spaces to place the code for
plotting and calculating the correlation coefficient. To finish, clean
up the narrative by removing these instructions.

Blah blah blah…

I’m some text, you should replace me with more meaningful text…

### Exercise 4

Add code and narrative as needed. Note that two R chunks are given but
they are not labeled. Use the convention from above to name them
appropriately.

### Exercise 5

Add code and narrative as needed. To add R chunks either type out the
backticks, curly braces, and the letter `r` or use the Insert chunk
button above, green C+.
